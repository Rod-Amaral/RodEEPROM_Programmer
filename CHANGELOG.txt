Rod's EEPROM Programmer, with Atmel microcontroller (Atmega 164, 324, 644, 1284)

V1.0.0

	COMMAND LINE INTERFACE:
	- Established Serial communication with a computer using the UART protocol
		- Steve Gunn's (a lecturer of mine) source code used for UART serial communcation
	- Displaying Main Menu on terminal
	- ClearScreen and CheckString functions made
	- CommandExecute function made, to execute a specific function based on an input string
	- ProcessInput function made, to process keyboard inputs from a serial connection to the computer
	- Allowed for user to type in command, and store the command in a string
	- Implemented support for special keyboard functions like DEL and arrow keys
	- Pressing enter will execute a command

	DEBUG:
	- Debug mode implemented, can be entered and exited, by using the command 'debug!'
	- Displays the numeric value of a character read
	- Displays the curent contents in the command string by sending the '`' character
	- Displays the command string before executing a command
	- To exit debug, pressing ESC, then '`', will also do so

	PROGRAMMER:
	- ProgrammerSetup function made for setup of pins
	- set_CE, set_OE, set_WE functions made, to set (high or low) CE OE and WE pins respectively
	- OutputData and OutputAddress functions made, to output the value given onto the repective pins
	- ReadData function made, to read the data on the data pins
	- Read and Write byte functions made
	- Continous Read and Write function made for continous data read/write operation
	- ClearEEPROM function made to write 0xff to all addresses
	- ClearCheck function made to check if the clear was successful, and give address of the first byte, that isn't 0xff
	- ReadEEPROM function made to deiplay the EEPROM contents

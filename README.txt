Rod's EEPROM Programmer, with Atmel microcontroller (Atmega 164, 324, 644, 1284)

This repository is for a simple Programmer for a 28 PDIP EEPROM (or less), using (40 PDIP) Atmel Microntrollers.

For the Microcontrollers mencioned above, how to wire the pins on the EEPROM is shown on _RodEEPROM_Programmer.h

This is still in the early stages, for now I just want to get it working, feel free to contribute.
